                                        of what a privilege it is to be alive, 
                                        to think, to enjoy, to love ...</p>

                                    <p>If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right,
                                         I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever
                                          truly harmed. It is the person who continues in 
                                          his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.</p>

                        </div>

                            <h1>Long post this time!</h1>
                            <p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: 
                                the people I deal with today will be meddling,
                                 ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. 
                                 They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. 
                                 But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil,
                                  and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related 
                                  to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind,
                                  and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can
                                   hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel 
                                   angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together 
                                   like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and 
                                   lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at 
                                   someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.</p>

                            within yourself in your way of thinking.</p>

                        but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.</p>

                             not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.</p>

        Rajan enthralled filmmakers and photographers from around the world as he propelled his

        <img src="img/Beatles.jpg" title="THE BEATLES" text="McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – 
        as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects 
        of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. 
        Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, 
        searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.">

         of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups. 
         Thus, in addition to criollos, mestizos, and Afro-Ecuadorians, some people belong 
         to the Amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast, Quechua Andean

        northern Taiwan.[30] It is bordered by the Xindian River on the south and the Tamsui 
        River on the west. The generally low-lying terrain of the central areas on the western 
        side of the municipality slopes upward to the south and east and especially to the north, 
        where it reaches the 1,120-meter tall Qixing Mountain, the highest

        As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature 
        individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. 
        India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat 
        destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.">
